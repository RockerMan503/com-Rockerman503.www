<p>Moonshine Tavern, located in Hong Kong, is a modern on taverns of old. Come in on Tavern Tuesdays for half off drinks and specials<img class="picture" src="img/sample.jpg" alt="Our Tavern" width="400" height="254"></p>
<p><b>Our Goal:</b> Our goal here at Moonshine Tavern is to create a feeling of a medieval tavern with the modern luxuries of today.

When it comes to dim sum, mixed drinks, and appetizers, our food speaks for itself. Our favorite review of our fair tavern is by Chua Lam’s review from March, 2016: </p> 
<blockquote>“This tavern may seem like a run-of-the-mill modern restaurant, but their food and atmosphere make me feel like I’m at home.” -Chua Lam, March 2016.</blockquote>
